                    Code Base React 199 is designed to ease developers into building react applications from scratch, providing a comprehensive reference for code structure and component design. Unlike traditional component libraries, Code Base React 199 offers ready-to-use code snippets that you can copy, paste, and customize to fit your specific needs. Although these snippets are ready to use, there are a few important prerequisites to keep in mind.
                    Therefore, it is essential <Button variant={"link-gray"} to={"/docs/prerequisite/library"} label={'to read the prerequisites'} /> before using Code Base React 199.

                    The creator of Code Base React 199, a seasoned developer, has often faced the challenges of starting projects from scratch, especially in frontend development. Developers are frequently left without the support of a UI/UX design system, making it difficult to anticipate the variations and future requirements of components. As projects evolve and new component variants are needed, maintaining and enhancing the codebase can become a daunting task, sometimes causing issues with existing code.
                    Code Base React 199 provides developers with a clear picture of all possible component variations when creating a new component. This foresight helps in designing flexible and scalable components from the start.
